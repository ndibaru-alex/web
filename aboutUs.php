      <h5 >The common operating philosophy at all Daca properties is attention to even the smallest details, exceptionally personal service and a continuous effort to meet and even foretell customer requirements. In addition, each property celebrates and reflects its area’s artistic idioms and cultural expressions with a view to giving clients a unique experience in every Daca. These values are central to Serena’s ethos and are the key elements that contribute to the strength and uniqueness of the brand</h5>

      	Tourism is about people, and we believe in introducing our visitors to the real character of their hosts. Our holiday destinations in East Africa and South Asia offer unusually complex and colourful ethnic tapestries, featuring a charismatic mix of peoples ranging from the scarlet-cloaked Maasai to the vibrant poeple of the world. This heritage is, however, fragile; and in order that it may be both preserved and nurtured for the future, we believe that the benefits of tourism must be shared with the local community
